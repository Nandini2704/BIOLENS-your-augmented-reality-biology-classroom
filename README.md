# 🌿 BIOLENS – Your Augmented Reality Biology Classroom

**BIOLENS** is an Android-based Augmented Reality (AR) application designed to revolutionize middle school biology education. By combining 3D animations, real-time image classification, and AR technology, BIOLENS helps students visualize complex biological processes interactively and engagingly — no physical lab required.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Object Detection (Leaf/Flower)** using ONNX + Barracuda  
- 🌱 **Leaf Mode:** Triggers options for `Photosynthesis` and `Plant Cycle`  
- 🌸 **Flower Mode:** Triggers options for `Self Pollination` and `Cross Pollination`  
- 📱 **Camera-based AR interaction** via ARCore + Unity  
- 🎞️ **Animated 3D Biology Models** created in Blender  
- 🧠 **Education-focused design** for middle school students (ages 12–15)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Unity** (AR development)  
- **ARCore** (marker-based AR)  
- **ONNX + Barracuda** (image classification in Unity)  
- **Blender** (3D animation)  
- **Firebase** (future integration for backend support)

## 🧬 How It Works

1. **upload  a image**  
  upload the image of a leaf or flower.

2. **Run Image Classification**  
   A trained ONNX model predicts the object category (Leaf or Flower).

3. **Trigger AR Scene**  
   Based on the prediction:
   - For **Leaf**, two buttons appear:  
     `Photosynthesis` 🌞 and `Plant Cycle` ♻️
   - For **Flower**, two buttons appear:  
     `Self Pollination` 🌸 and `Cross Pollination` 🌼

4. **Visualize the Concept**  
   Clicking a button launches a full 3D animation with audio/text explanations.

## 🧠 Future Plans

- Add support for other plant parts (roots, stems, seeds)  
- Expand biology topics (e.g., cell division, human anatomy)  
- Gamify quizzes and interactions  
- Firebase integration for progress tracking
